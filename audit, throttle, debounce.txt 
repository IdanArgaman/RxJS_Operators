throttleTime(300)

AFTER 1 event has gone through, throttleTime will allow events to go through again AFTER 300ms. But only for events created AFTER the 300ms.

debounceTime(300ms)

Will first wait and then continue, also reset its timer when new value is emitted from the stream.

auditTime(300ms)

Just like debounceTime , auditTime will wait for 300ms and then continues. But it will ALWAYS continue after 300ms and not reset its timer.
